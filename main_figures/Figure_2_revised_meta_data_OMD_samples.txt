SAMN03444948 The Caspian Sea is the world's largest enclosed body of water. The northern part of the Caspian sea is largely a freshwater habitat. Salinity increases gradually towards the middle part, and the southernmost part is a stable brackish ecosystem with 1.1% salinty (ca. one third of the open ocean). This biosample contains metagenomic data from 50m depth of the Caspian Sea. Sampling was performed at the end of summer, a time when the water column is stratified based on temperature. Briefly, 50L of water was collected from this depth and filtered serially through 20, 5 and 0.22 micron filters. this metagenomes deposited here was obtained by sequencing (Illumina HiSeq) of the 0.22 micron fraction. aquatic metagenome

SAMN03444909 The Caspian Sea is the world's largest enclosed body of water. The northern part of the Caspian sea is largely a freshwater habitat. Salinity increases gradually towards the middle part, and the southernmost part is a stable brackish ecosystem with 1.1% salinty (ca. one third of the open ocean). This biosample contains metagenomic data from 15m depth of the Caspian. Briefly, 50L of water was collected from this depth and filtered serially through 20, 5 and 0.22 micron filters. This metagenome deposited here was obtained by sequencing (Illumina HiSeq) of the 0.22 micron fraction. aquatic metagenome

SAMN02924047 The Amazon region has the largest hydrographic basin on the planet, the one that includes Amazon River. Besides, it shows a great biological diversity, including related to microorganisms, however, they are poorly studied. The microorganisms are responsible for most of the biogeochemical cycles that determine the terrestrial environment and the freshwater and marine ecosystems, and they can be largely explored in biotechnology. In this work it was used DNA extracted from Solimoes river filtered water, to study the microbial diversity, using metagenomics approaches. freshwater metagenome

SAMN02905736 The Amazon region has the largest hydrographic basin on the planet, the one that includes Amazon River. Besides, it shows a great biological diversity, including related to microorganisms, however, they are poorly studied. The microorganisms are responsible for most of the biogeochemical cycles that determine the terrestrial environment and the freshwater and marine ecosystems, and they can be largely explored in biotechnology. In this work it was used DNA extracted from Solimoes river filtered water, to study the microbial diversity, using metagenomics approaches. freshwater metagenome

SAMN02905733 The Amazon region has the largest hydrographic basin on the planet, the one that includes Amazon River. Besides, it shows a great biological diversity, including related to microorganisms, however, they are poorly studied. The microorganisms are responsible for most of the biogeochemical cycles that determine the terrestrial environment and the freshwater and marine ecosystems, and they can be largely explored in biotechnology. In this work it was used DNA extracted from Solimoes river filtered water, to study the microbial diversity, using metagenomics approaches. freshwater metagenome

SAMEA104141253 During the Norwegian young sea Ice cruise 2015 (N-ICE2015), that took place in drifting pack ice north of Svalbard between January-June 2015, seawater was collected, at 5, 20 or 50, 250 m depth in 9th March, 27th April and 16th June, together with physical and biogeochemical data. Through the massively parallel sequencing of environmental DNA (metagenomics) we expect to get a snapshot of the Arctics microbiome structure, key functions and dynamic through the dark-light transition. unidentified bacterium;bacterium

Through the massively parallel sequencing of environmental DNA (metagenomics) we expect to get a snapshot of the Arctics microbiome structure, key functions and dynamic through the dark-light transition. unidentified bacterium;bacterium

SAMEA4397409 This sample (TARA_R110002094) was collected at station TARA_175 during campaign TARA_20130629Z of the Tara Oceans expedition (2009-2013), using a Rosette Vertical Sampling System [RVSS]. The sampling event (TARA_20130711T0613Z_175_Combined-EVENTS_CAST) occurred at position latitudeN=79.3349 and longitudeE=66.2954, on date/time=2013-07-11T06:13:00, at a depth of 10-100 m. The sample material was collected in the marine biome (ENVO:00000447) targeting a [MIX] marine epipelagic wind mixed layer (ENVO:01000061). The sample material was size-fractionated (<0.22 micrometres) and prepared on board using protocol [SEQ-(FeCl3)_W<0.22] for later detection and identification of biological and molecular entities (nucleotides) by sequencing (SEQ) methods. This sample may be used for example in biodiversity and metagenomics studies of viruses. This sample has no known replicate. marine metagenome

SAMN15220987 Samples from two different depths (10 and 20m) were collected on December 13th of 2018 at a mariculture cage of adult gilthead seabream cultures (Sparus aurata) from the Western Mediterranean Sea, close to the coast of Guardamar del Segura (Alicante, Spain). Fish farm cages covered had a hight of 15m. The shallowest sample was collected from inside the net cage, whereas the remaining sample was collected from below this structure. For each depth, one seawater sample (200 L each) was collected and quickly filtered. Seawater samples were then sequentially filtered on board through 20, 5 and 0.22 m pore size polycarbonate filters (Millipore). DNA extraction was performed from the 0.22 and 5 m filters (free-living and particle-attached bacteria, respectively) following the phenol:chloroform protocol extraction. Metagenomes were sequenced using Illumina Nextseq (150 bp, paired-end reads). marine metagenome

SAMN15220986 Samples from two different depths (10 and 20m) were collected on December 13th of 2018 at a mariculture cage of adult gilthead seabream cultures (Sparus aurata) from the Western Mediterranean Sea, close to the coast of Guardamar del Segura (Alicante, Spain). Fish farm cages covered had a hight of 15m. The shallowest sample was collected from inside the net cage, whereas the remaining sample was collected from below this structure. For each depth, one seawater sample (200 L each) was collected and quickly filtered. Seawater samples were then sequentially filtered on board through 20, 5 and 0.22 m pore size polycarbonate filters (Millipore). DNA extraction was performed from the 0.22 and 5 m filters (free-living and particle-attached bacteria, respectively) following the phenol:chloroform protocol extraction. Metagenomes were sequenced using Illumina Nextseq (150 bp, paired-end reads). marine metagenome

SAMEA3275590 The Objective of this sampling trip is to contribute to the âOcean Sampling Dayâ initiative through providing environmental water samples from the Red Sea, based on OSP standardized protocols. The Red Sea is a large marine ecosystem, characterized by a relatively high salinity and temperature with complex and diverse biological life including unique coral reefs. The two Red Sea samples were obtained near the coast of Hurghada, a main tourist center. Both sample sites Abu Hashish and Ras Disha are shallow diving sites (5 -30 m). Abu Hashish is characterized by hard, soft and table corals abundance. Ras Disha is also unique for itâs large patches of seagrass. marine metagenome

SAMEA3275646 To collect surface seawater on the summer solstice day from the L4 mooring in the Western English Channel (OSD1) and to filter the water using the standardized protocol NPL022. The filters will be sent to Germany and subsequently processed and analysed for the prokariotic fraction. The results will be part of the global campaign OSD data-set which will allow the scientific community to better understand the microbial diversity and function in the light of climate change assessment. The data-set so established will be used as a reference for future studies and the base for developing biotechnologies. marine metagenome

SAMN04574157 This study is aimed to explore the microbial lifestyle in ocean and interpret metabolic potentials using metagenome dataset. Furthermore, it is important to learn about various mode of energy consumption that may support marine microbes i.e. photoautotrophy, chemoautotrophy and heterotrophy. marine metagenome
